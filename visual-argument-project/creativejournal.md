Since this is my first time using Gimp, a lot of my time has spent on familiarizing myself with the application. After I watched a few tutorials on the app's major tools, I then spent time figuring out the direction for my project. I had a lot of mockups I had drew up, but it was difficult for me to decide which one would be the easiest to execute. I originally wanted the woman to be in front of a floral background, similar to the works of Kehinde Wiley, but many of the options on unsplash were either too busy or too bare. Since I do want to use words to protray my message, I decided to go for a more magazine cover route, where the image of the woman would be pieced together using other images. After class on Monday, I took the time to compile a handful of photos that could possibly work. However, later that night, I ran into a lot of difficulty removing the background for the flower photos. Because of how precise the edges of the flowers are, I looked towards tool like foreground select and the paths tool. I had no real issue removing the background for the woman's photo, as for that I just used the layer merge trick, but for some reason I just could  not figure out how to do it with the flowers. Eventually, after hours of work and countless YouTube tutorials, I realized the videos' advice didn't work because the users were not using Mac like I was. But once I figured this out, I was able to properly start assembling my piece. Today was filled with cutting, placing, and arranging the flowers, and the next few days I will continue to work on the other photographic elements I want to use.
