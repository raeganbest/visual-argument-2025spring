## About the Piece
My visual argument, "The Perfect Woman," serves as both a form of social commentary and parody on the treatment of Black women in society. This piece plays on the "Strong Black Woman" archetype, as the magazine issue attempts to advise Black female readers on how they can become more respected by others in society. The use of Covergirl is meant to parody the methods of sales and persuasion the company's advertisements try to provoke, and seeks to suggest that a Black "Covergirl" is one that adheres to the standards and norms that society promotes. Below is a full breakdown of all the symbolism and subliminal messages in the piece.

## Creative Process
When the assignment was first introduced, I immediately had a lot of ideas about what I could do. Inspired by conversations I have had recently in my Dimensions of Racism and Sex, Race, and Popular Culture courses, along with just overall considering the current political climate, I thought that bringing awareness to how Black women are treated in society was an important topic to address. Before class had started, I had seen the quote, “Never forget, when excellence steps into the room mediocrity gets paranoid” by Hannah L. Drake, and initially wanted to do a piece that focused on uplifting Black women while criticizing society’s perceptions of them. This version would have highlighted many popular Black women (such as Michelle Obama, Beyoncé, and Simone Biles) that are mostly hated because of them being a powerful Black woman, whether that be because of implicit or explicit biases. However, early searches on Unsplash didn’t have the best options, so I then went for a different route. Here are some of the early sketches I had:

One thing I was really set on doing was incorporating a floral background in my piece, using the works of Kehinde Wiley as inspiration. The very first draft I did was looking reminiscent of their pieces, but I realized it would be very difficult to add words in, which I felt was the main basis for properly forming my argument, with such a busy background.

I then had this idea for making a magazine cover, knowing that they often portray a very superficial perspective on beauty. I then went on Google and Pinterest to find some different inspiration (which I continued to do as I worked), and ultimately, these were the main photos I took inspiration from:
