## About the Piece
My visual argument, "The Perfect Woman," serves as both a form of social commentary and parody on the treatment of Black women in society. This piece plays on the "Strong Black Woman" archetype, as the magazine issue attempts to advise Black female readers on how they can become more respected by others in society. The use of Covergirl is meant to parody the methods of sales and persuasion the company's advertisements try to provoke, and seeks to suggest that a Black "Covergirl" is one that adheres to the standards and norms that society promotes. Below is a full breakdown of all the symbolism and subliminal messages in the piece.

## Creative Process
When the assignment was first introduced, I immediately had a lot of ideas about what I could do. Inspired by conversations I have had recently in my Dimensions of Racism and Sex, Race, and Popular Culture courses, along with just overall considering the current political climate, I thought that bringing awareness to how Black women are treated in society was an important topic to address. Before class had started, I had seen the quote, “Never forget, when excellence steps into the room mediocrity gets paranoid” by Hannah L. Drake, and initially wanted to do a piece that focused on uplifting Black women while criticizing society’s perceptions of them. This version would have highlighted many popular Black women (such as Michelle Obama, Beyoncé, and Simone Biles) that are mostly hated because of them being a powerful Black woman, whether that be because of implicit or explicit biases. However, early searches on Unsplash didn’t have the best options, so I then went for a different route. Here are some of the early sketches I had:

One thing I was really set on doing was incorporating a floral background in my piece, using the works of Kehinde Wiley as inspiration. The very first draft I did was looking reminiscent of their pieces, but I realized it would be very difficult to add words in (which I felt was the main basis for properly forming my argument) with such a busy background.

I then had this idea for making a magazine cover, knowing that they often portray a very superficial perspective on beauty. I then went on Google and Pinterest to find some different inspiration (which I continued to do as I worked), and ultimately, these were the main photos I took inspiration from:

I used Unsplash to source all the photos for my piece, and then spent the early days using foreground and scissor select to remove the background of the butterfly, flowers, leaves, and woman photos. For the pieces used on the face, I simply just cropped them down to a smaller size, because I wanted them to especially look displaced and wonky. Because this was my first time using GIMP, I looked at a lot of different tutorials to help me out.

After the main focus of the piece was put together (which my first version somehow got deleted, but I was able to redo it pretty quickly), I then contemplated making the woman look less realistic. I considered making her look illustrated using the cartoon filter, or more like a statue using decolorization, gaussian blur, and color curves (and YouTube tutorials). The statue idea was to further symbolize the act of “dehumanizing” her, but it ended up not looking quite right when all the other elements were added back on.

When it came to adding the written traits, I played around with different ways of doing it. I at one point had them added in a more scrapbook/magazine collage way like the other elements, but they didn’t fit correctly in the hair. That’s when I decided to make them the focal point of the magazine’s headline. To get the different fonts, I downloaded them from Google fonts and assigned them based on association. For the complete draft submission, I made sure all the words and layers of the piece were arranged in a way I found most effective. My peers only left minimal changes and suggestions, but after incorporating their advice and adding other comments from Professor Miller, I was able to submit my final drafts on 2/26. 


## Generative Contraints
**Baseline Criteria**

✅Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus and guide viewers' attention

✅Have a clear message or intervention that you can articulate in your reflection: Dedicated section in my reflection that analyzes the piece and explains critical elements that may not be caught at first glance 

✅If including words, choose a font that matches the style/tone of your piece
- Title and majority of headline written in Marcellus to resemble the actual Covergirl font
- Traits written in their own fonts to be distinct from one another, and to represent their connotative meanings
  - “Pretty” in Whisper 
  - “Soft” in Indie Flower
  - “Elegant” in Monsieur La Doulaise 
  - "Feminine” in Rochester
  - “Intelligent” in Marion Bold 
  - “Natural” in Staatliches
        
✅Credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required - Asset list can be found in “visual-argument-project” folder
    
✅Meet deadlines and requirements from the assignment page (see: reflection with screenshots and at least 500 words, project title in README)

✅Use at least 3 layers

✅Use at least 1 tool beyond select, move, and text

✅Use non-default commit messages that say what's changing (and maybe even why)

 
**Aspirational Inspirations**

✅Organize your files through layer labeling, layer groups, repo structure - Layer groups for the tile, headline, leaves, flowers, butterflies, face pieces, and headline

✅Use multiple design strategies in ways that compliment each other (whether to reinforce a single shared focus or to add nuance / surprise down the hierarchy)

✅Refer to assigned readings in explaining your design choices, e.g. font pairings, hierarchical levels, etc
| Principle | Purpose | Application | 
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| Proximity |  Elements that are closer together are more related | Grouping of flowers, leaves, and butterflies together; Group of traits together; Using white space to strengthen groupings - Space between groups of elements in hair |
| Similarity  | Elements that are similar are perceived to be more related | Similarity through color - “Cover” and “Perfect” being white to draw a connection between these words and whiteness |
| Figure ground | The perception of elements as either objects of focus or the background; distinguishable | Contrast - Desaturated background to make the woman pop out and draw in the viewer’s attention; Size - woman is large on the page to make her be the focus, rather than the background | 
| Dominance | Attracts the eye and gets noticed first | The woman is the largest element in the piece | 
| Focal Points | Areas of interests, stand out after the dominant element | Eyes and lips are made to be focal points because of their difference in shape, size, and color | 
| Fonts | Evoke emotion and have personality | Each of the traits written in a different font to illustrate the word’s connotative meaning | 

✅Be bright and bold to make your work pop and draw the eye: Bright colors used for the elements in the hair

✅Use more than 3 distinct overlapping layers: 53 layers (many of the pieces in the hair are their own layers, along with the text groupings)

✅Use more than 3 tools beyond select, move, and text that are new to you

*Color Curves*: Used to brighten the image of the woman

✅Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately articulate your message/argument

Mia was able to give a very thoughtful and thorough analysis of my piece: 
 <img width="908" alt="mia's analysis" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619e89b9-3f65-4d2d-9fae-2e0505e9e9ec" />


## Peer Feedback
My peers had predominantly positive responses to my full draft. A common theme among their suggestions was to find more ways to make certain elements pop. 

<img width="908" alt="mia's feedback" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6423503-74a5-4498-9f30-7b758a54b03e" />

To incorporate Mia’s suggestion, I added a drop shadow to the elements in the woman’s hair. On the right is a before view and on the left is after.

For Morgan’s suggestion, I played around with the lens blur for the woman’s shadow to make it look more realistic and better blended. The first picture is before and the second picture is after these changes.

Additionally she suggested making “The Perfect Woman” pop. Hannah also had a similar suggestion, so I added a shadow on “Perfect” to make it stand out more, along with making it the only word in the phrase to be in white. I also italicized the word.

## Conclusion
Overall, I am very happy with the way my piece turned out. Over the years I have had a little practice with Adobe Photoshop, but I am glad this assignment gave me the opportunity to properly play around with these types of applications. While GIMP is not the most advanced application, I was able to get used to it much easier than I was with Audacity. I would honestly love to do another visual argument to add to my final portfolio.
